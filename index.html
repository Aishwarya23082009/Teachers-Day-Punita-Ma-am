        <h1>Dear Punita Ma'am</h1>
        <h3> 
PUNITA NEHRU MA'AM, the principal of MY school
            <br>
Whose work is certainly on schedule
            <br>
Oh!! She is an enlightened soul
            <br>
Preparing us for the future is her goal
            <br>
<br>
To me she is more like a mother
            <br>
She is better than any other
            <br>
She works so hard day and night
            <br>
            
She'll make Carmel's future bright
            <br>
<br>
            
There is mysticism in her eyes
            <br>
She's so calm, so wise
            <br>
There is serenity on her face
            <br>
Symbolic of simplicity and grace
            <br>
<br>
She takes life as a happy song
            <br>
Her ideals are so inspiring, so strong
            <br>
Just like an angel sent from above
            <br>
She provides us with unconditional love
            <br>
<br>
She supports us with encouraging words
            <br>
Her voice- as sweet as chirping birds
            <br>
She also gives us freedom to have fun
            <br>
And helps us show our talents to everyone
            <br>
<br>
Many a times she has to scold
            <br>
But that is because she wants us to be bold
            <br>
She helps us to mould our attitude
            <br>
For her our hearts full of gratitude
<br>
            <br>
She teaches us how important its to pray
            <br>
She helps us when we forget our way
            <br>
She motivates us to make full use of our potential
            <br>
She feels physical training is very essential
            <br>
<br>
She has a special place in my heart
            <br>
How beautifully she plays her part
            <br>
We say that she is the best
            <br>
Better than all the rest!!!
            <br>
